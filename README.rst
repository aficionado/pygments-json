pygments-json
=============

Pygments_ is a syntax highlighting tool that supports a wide range of
languages and data formats.  However, pygments does not provide a JSON highlighter.  JSON can,
of course, be parsed by the Javascript lexer, but the resulting output looks very plain and
really provides almost no value over non-highlighted text.

pygments-json_ attempts to provide more interesting syntax highlighting which correctly distinguishes
between attribute names and values.  I'm new to pygments and to python packaging, so please don't hesitate
to tell me if I've done something wrong or if the JSON parsing doesn't quite work for you.
